    "description": "<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is the CryptoPunks NFT Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">CryptoPunks is an Ethereum-based NFT collection of 10,000 unique art characters. Out of the 10,000 Punks &ndash;&nbsp;there are 6,039 males, 3,840 females, 88 zombies, 24 apes, and 9 alien punks. Due to their rarity, the zombie, ape, and alien punks are priced&nbsp;significantly higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The CryptoPunks collection is one of the earliest and most popular collections in the NFT space, with some high-profile celebrities owning their own Punk. Some of these celebrities include Serena Williams, Logan Paul, Mark Cuban, and SnoopDogg. The CryptoPunks NFT collection was so highly sought after by art collectors that they were even sold at Sotheby&#39;s and Christie&#39;s, which are international auction houses.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Launched in June 2017, 9,000 of the 10,000 NFTs were free for mint, while the other remaining 1,000 NFTs were held by Larva Labs. Four years later, by 2021, the same NFTs were sold for millions of dollars.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The CryptoPunks NFT collection was algorithmically generated by a pixelated character generator that assigned each individual character their unique traits. The algorithm ensures that no two NFTs in the collection are the same, making each of them unique. Generally speaking, the CryptoPunks that do not have many unique features have a lower floor price.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Who Is the Team Behind CryptoPunks?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The NFT collection was actually released as an experiment by two Canadian software developers from Larva Labs studio. At the time of the release, the ERC-721 token standard did not exist, and the two software developers, Matt Hall&nbsp;and John Watkinson, released the CryptoPunks collection as an experiment as custom contract NFTs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">According to the team, the CryptoPunks collection drew inspiration from the 1970s London Punk scene, the sci-fi cyberpunk movement, the popular movie Blade Runner, and the book Neuromancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2022, the team behind Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT, Yuga Labs, acquired CryptoPunks along with <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/meebits\" target=\"_blank\">Meebits</a>, another popular NFT collection. Now that they own three of the most popular NFT collections in the NFT space, Yuga Labs has established itself as a big player in the NFT space.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is the Utility of the CryptoPunks Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Being a holder of the CryptoPunks NFT collection gives holders exclusive access to member-only events where users are required to hold a CryptoPunk NFT to participate. This helps holders to interact with other holders and get access to new features. Having been one of the pioneers in the NFT space, the CryptoPunks collection has built up a pretty strong sense of community. As such, some holders actually purchase the CryptoPunks NFT to gain access to the community and new releases.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As the CrytoPunks collection is one of the most iconic and popular in the NFT space, the CryptoPunk NFTs are also often regarded as a symbol of prestige and wealth. Therefore, oftentimes many owners of the CryptoPunks NFT collection will use their NFT as their profile picture or avatar on social media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some of the owners will also <a href=\"https://decrypt.co/77872/cryptopunk-owners-have-new-way-make-money-renting-out-their-avatars\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rent their NFTs</a> out or use their CryptoPunks collection as collateral to <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/blur-and-blend-nft-marketplace\" target=\"_blank\">borrow ETH</a>. This is part of Blur&rsquo;s lending program, Blend, where users are able to borrow and lend NFTs through a peer-to-peer platform.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As the NFT space continues to grow, it is likely that the utility of the NFT collection will continue to expand.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What makes CryptoPunks special?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The CryptoPunks collection is known for its culture significance in the history of Ethereum and NFT. It is touted as the first <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/glossary/pfp\">PFP</a> project and sometimes the first NFT collection that managed to retain its value.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Wrapped CryptoPunks&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Wrapped CryptoPunks NFT collection is a derivative of the original CryptoPunks NFT collection. As mentioned earlier, the CryptoPunks NFT collections are made on a custom contract. This means that they are only available to be traded on the Ethereum chain.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When you wrap your CryptoPunk, it is essentially changing your NFT to an ERC-721 token standard, which is currently used to power most of the NFTs we see today. This allows your wrapped CryptoPunks to be used in other decentralized applications besides Ethereum.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The wrapping process is reversible, and NFT holders are able to wrap and unwrap their CryptoPunks at will. However, it is important to note that the process to wrap the CryptoPunks NFT includes interacting with smart contracts via etherscan.io and that failure to complete all the steps correctly can result in a loss of the NFT.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Some of these celebrities include Justin Bieber, Eminem, Serena Williams, Stephen Curry, Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal, and Jimmy Fallon. Celebrities and investors were not the only ones interested in the collection, even big corporate companies like Adidas purchased their own Ape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Launched in April 2021, the project was available for mint at 0.08 ETH and was sold out within 12 hours. Less than 2 years later, the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/10-most-expensive-nfts-ever-sold\" target=\"_blank\">most expensive ape</a> was sold at an astounding 3.4 Million USD.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Who Is the Team Behind BAYC?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The NFT project was created by Yuga Labs, a team of four individuals who preferred to use their online pseudonyms and only later revealed their identities to the public.

Holding an Ape also allows the owners commercial and branding rights to their NFTs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BAYC holders are granted exclusive access to &lsquo;THE BATHROOM&rsquo; and a private Discord server. &lsquo;THE BATHROOM&rsquo; is a collaborative community board where holders are able to draw pixels at intervals of 15 minutes. The Discord server allows BAYC holders to interact with other holders and get access to new features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BAYC holders are also granted access to the Yuga Lab&rsquo;s projects. This will include other NFT collections and the BAYC metaverse (Otherside).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Bored Ape Yacht Club Ecosystem</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-apecoin-ape-ecosystem\" target=\"_blank\">BAYC ecosystem</a>, the team also launched its own native token, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/apecoin\" target=\"_blank\">Apecoin</a>, several spin-off NFT collections, and its own <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-metaverse-crypto-blockchain-nft-game\" target=\"_blank\">metaverse</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Launched in March 2022, Yuga Labs released their native token APE, which functions as a governance token. This ERC-20 token APE allows holders to execute transactions, make governing decisions, and participate in the ecosystem. During the launch, a portion of the token supply was airdropped to BAYC and MAYC owners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yuga Labs also launched spin-off collections such as the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/mutant-ape-yacht-club\" target=\"_blank\">Mutant Ape Yacht Club</a> (MAYC) and the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/bored-ape-kennel-club\" target=\"_blank\">Bored Ape Kennel Club</a> (BAKC). In August 2021, Yuga Labs airdropped BAYC holders a &ldquo;mutant serum&rdquo;. With the serum, BAYC holders were able to mutate or mint their own Bored Ape into a Mutant Ape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In July 2021, BAYC holders were airdropped the BAKC collection. The BAKC collection functions as a companion collection in a bid to reward BAYC holders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The BAYC ecosystem also consists of the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/otherdeed-for-otherside\" target=\"_blank\">Otherside Metaverse</a>. While the metaverse is still currently under development, when completed, the metaverse will be a virtual world where their NFTs can be used as playable characters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In September 2023, Yuga Labs announced the launch of a new game, Legend of the Mara (LotM), a collection-based 2D strategy game. The game is a sub-universe within the broader Otherside metaverse game.</p>\r\n",

    "description": "<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is the Pudgy Penguins NFT Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pudgy Penguins is a collection of 8,888 unique NFTs featuring cute cartoon penguins, which are generated from a collection of 150 different hand-drawn traits. The motto behind the NFT collection is &ldquo;spreading good vibes across the meta.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Launched on 22 July 2021, the Pudgy Penguin collection sold out within <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pudgypenguins/status/1420430560405643273?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">19 minutes</a> and had an original mint price of 0.3 ETH. Just a week later, the floor price of the collection had already increased to 2.4 ETH. On the 13 of August 2022, the rarest Pudgy (#6873) was sold for 400 ETH.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Who Is the Team Behind Pudgy Penguins?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Pudgy Penguins were originally founded by a team of 4 college students &ndash;&nbsp; Mrtubby, Mickyj, Jonah, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ColeThereum\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cole</a>. However, the team allegedly was <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/07/pudgy-penguins-nft-project-ousts-founders-as-mood-turns-icy/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">not able to follow their initial promises</a> to the community, such as launching a children&#39;s book and a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-metaverse-crypto-blockchain-nft-game\" target=\"_blank\">metaverse</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In April 2022, the Pudgy Penguin NFT collection was acquired by Luca Netz (Luca Schnetzle) for $2.5 million. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LucaNetz\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Luca Netz</a> is a well-known Los Angeles entrepreneur, and along with his team, have since worked hard to rebrand the collection.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Currently, the Pudgy Penguin <a href=\"https://pudgypenguins.com/about-us\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">team</a> consists of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/0xLoMel\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lorenzo Melendez</a> (CTO), Nicholas Ravid (CMO), <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chefgoyardi\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Lobanov</a> (CCO), <a href=\"https://twitter.com/empathyandip\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jennifer Mcglone</a> (CLO), and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drkaizu\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Kaizu</a> (Head Of Operations).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is the Utility of the Pudgy Penguins Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Holders of Pudgy Penguins are known as &ldquo;Pengus&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Huddle,&rdquo; and they are given access to a number of exclusive benefits such as exclusive events and experiences.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pudgy Penguin holders get exclusive access to exclusive events, such as meetups, parties, and concerts. These meetups, which are usually held in major cities around the world, allow holders to interact with other holders, building a strong supportive community.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pudgy holders are also able to license and use their penguins for marketing purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The Pudgy Penguins Ecosystem</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Other than the Pudgy Penguin NFT collection, the team also produces official expansions to give away to Pudgy Holders.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One such expansion is the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/lilpudgys\" target=\"_blank\">Lil Pudgy NFT collection </a>which was introduced in December 2021. The Lil Pudgy is a collection of 22,222 NFTs, of which 8,888 were given complimentary to Pudgy Penguin holders, and the remaining 13,334 were sold in a public sale. According to the website, the Lil Pudgys collection is of northern descent and are allies in the fight against the evil bears of negativity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In January 2023, the Lil Pudgy NFT collection announced a partnership with <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-layerzero-interoperability\" target=\"_blank\">LayerZero</a>, which enabled cross-chain functionality, allowing Lil Pudgy NFTs to travel across different chains such as Polygon, the BNB Smart Chain, and Arbitrum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pudgy holders were also able to claim the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/pudgyrods\" target=\"_blank\">Pudgy Rod NFT collection</a> for free. The Pudgy Rod NFT collection is meant to be a companion collection of fishing rods that the Pudgys would use. However, during the reveal of the NFTs, the community was disappointed, and the founders faced negative backlash.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On 18 May 2023, the team announced the release of physical Pudgy Penguin merchandise, which was based on the Pudgy Penguins IP.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Social Media Presence&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Pudgy Penguin collection also has an impressive social media presence apart from the typical NFT collector audience. On <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/pudgypenguins/?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>, the Pudgy Penguin collection posts a series of cute short videos and encouraging posts, which has garnered the project a massive following of 696K followers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The same can be said of its <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@pudgypenguins?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Tiktok</a> account, which has garnered 1.7 million likes and 67K followers, from its short-form video content. While these videos and posts are not necessarily related to the NFT sphere, they give the Pudgy Penguins a personality, increasing the visibility of the project.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Holding an Ape also allows the owners commercial and branding rights to their NFTs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MAYC holders are granted exclusive access to &lsquo;THE BATHROOM&rsquo; and a private Discord server. &lsquo;THE BATHROOM&rsquo; is a collaborative community board where holders are able to draw pixels at intervals of 15 minutes. The Discord server allows other BAYC and MAYC holders to interact with other holders and get access to new features.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">MAYC holders are also granted access to the Yuga Lab&rsquo;s projects. This will include other NFT collections and the BAYC metaverse (Otherside).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The Bored Ape Yacht Club Ecosystem&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As part of the ecosystem, the team also launched its own native token, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/apecoin\" target=\"_blank\">Apecoin</a>, several spin-off NFT collections, and its own metaverse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Launched in March 2022, Yuga Labs released their native token APE, which functions as a governance token. This ERC-20 token APE allows holders to execute transactions, make governing decisions, and participate in the ecosystem. During the launch, a portion of the token supply was airdropped to BAYC and MAYC owners.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yuga Labs also launched another spin-off collection &ndash;&nbsp;the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/bored-ape-kennel-club\" target=\"_blank\">Bored Ape Kennel Club</a> (BAKC). In July 2021, BAYC holders were airdropped the BAKC collection. The BAKC collection functions as a companion collection in a bid to reward BAYC holders.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The BAYC ecosystem also consists of the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/otherdeed-for-otherside\" target=\"_blank\">Otherside Metaverse</a>. While the metaverse is still currently under development, when completed, the metaverse will be a virtual world where their NFTs can be used as playable characters.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The first of its kind, xNFTs refer to executable NFTs, which contain embedded executable scripts. This means that, unlike regular NFTs, xNFTs contain code that gives the holder ownership rights over its execution.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On 20 April 2023, minting for the Mad Lads NFT collection went live and sold out within minutes. At launch, the project had a mint price of 6.9 SOL. Less than a week later, one of these NFT <a href=\"https://solscan.io/tx/24XETqkWVhAeypeX5Rx24cXXScqUxV6jQ8GRVpSNNB69VUwRLTjAzjHct5EP7w5zyp6kW66EhFAnQvAcPuaUZkjg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sold</a> for 3625 SOL, amounting to $74,742.08 USD.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Being the first xNFT in the space, the project was extremely hyped and the team had to delay the mint date due to overwhelming traffic. Being extremely hyped, the Mad Lads NFT project has been credited for the <a href=\"https://ambcrypto.com/mad-lads-comes-to-the-rescue-of-solanas-ailing-nft-landscape-details-inside/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">revitalization of Solana NFTs</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Who Is the Team Behind Mad Lads?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Mad Lads NFT project was created by <a href=\"https://www.coral.community/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Coral</a>, a framework development company on the Solana blockchain. When the Mad Labs NFT collection launched, the only supported wallet for the xNFT was <a href=\"https://www.backpack.app/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Backpack</a>, which was also owned by Coral.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Coral was co-founded by Armani Ferrante and Tristan Yver. Ferrante, who is currently the CEO of Coral, has an extensive background in software engineering. The CTO of Coral, Yver is a blockchain developer who also took on the role of lead developer for the Mad Lads NFT collection.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is the Utility of the Mad Lads Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As mentioned, as the Mad Lads collection are executable NFTs, this unlocks a whole range of features of holders as xNFTs are able to interact with other Web3 applications. This can include a wide range of utilities, such as integration into Web3 games or decentralized applications.</p>\r\n",

    "description": "<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What is the Milady Maker NFT collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Milady Maker is a collection of 10,000 generative pfpNFTs in a neochibi aesthetic inspired by street-style tribes. This means that the NFT collection was meant to be profile pictures inspired by a specific anime art style.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Launched in March 2021, the collection had a mint price of 0.05 ETH. Used frequently among Twitter memes, the floor price of the collection was already at 0.2 ETH by the end of 2021. In May 2023, Elon Musk shared a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1656326406618619910\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Milady meme</a> on Twitter, causing the project price to skyrocket further, with some speculating that Elon owned his own Milady NFT.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To this day, Milady is still used frequently in Twitter memes as reaction pictures. During Binance&rsquo;s 2023 Annual Awards, they announced Milady as the &lsquo;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BSCNews/status/1679877997216530436\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NFT Project of the Year</a>&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Who Is the Team Behind Milady?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Milady collection was created by Remilia Collective, the same team behind the companion NFT collection &lsquo;<a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/redacted-remilio-babies\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Redacted Remilio Babies</a>&rsquo;. While the team behind the Milady collection is anonymous, the CEO of Miladys self-doxxed herself, revealing herself as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CharlotteFang77\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Miya</a>, a controversial 4chan internet personality.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, due to the backlash faced by the community following her self-doxx, Miya, also known as Charlotte Fang, has since stepped down as CEO of the company.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What is the Utility of the Milady Collection?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Milady Maker NFT collection has a number of utilities. While the NFT collection is meant to be used as profile pictures, Milady also labels itself as an aesthetic, a lifestyle, and a community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milady NFT holders are given exclusive access to certain events and benefits. This includes the Milady VRtube, Raves, Bootlegs, and a Minecraft Metaverse.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Milady VRtube is a service that allows Milady holders to use their NFTs as an avatar for calls and live-streaming platforms via the <a href=\"https://www.hologram.xyz/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hologram application</a>. This is slightly similar to Apple&rsquo;s Memoji work, as users can pose as their own Memoji avatar in calls.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Milady holders are also given exclusive access to physical raves. These raves are party meetups that take place with local underground scenes such as NYC and Tokyo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Milady Bootlegs is a merchandise store that sells designer knockoffs with Milady logos. These allow the community and its holders to show their love and support for the collection.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Milady holders are also given exclusive access to the Milady Minecraft server. In the server, there are several special features, such as land plots and events, that are only made available for NFT holders. This allows and encourages the interaction between the community and NFT holders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Other than that, the Milady collection has also been known to help raise money for charity. In December 2021, the team supposedly&nbsp;donated 1 ETH to Save the Children.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What is the Drip Score System Within the Milady Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Each individual Milady NFT has a drip score rating the overall aesthetic value and stylishness of the NFT.&nbsp; To calculate the NFT&rsquo;s drip score, each cosmetic is scored on its rarity, then weighted against the prominence of its slot, with a multiplier applied for theme or costume complete badges. The Miladys are each given a letter grade for their drip score. The ratings range from D, C, B, A, S, and SS.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The Milady Ecosystem</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Other than the Milady NFT collection, the Remilia Collective team also sometimes produces official expansions to give away to Milady Holders. One such expansion is a <a href=\"https://miladymaker.net/banners/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Generative NFT Banner</a> that was a free mint for Milady Holders. The <a href=\"https://opensea.io/collection/banners-nft\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Generative NFT banner </a>mint was made in collaboration with community-submitted captions on places such as Wikipedia user pages and forum signatures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another free mint that was given to Milady holders is the NFT collection named &lsquo;<a href=\"https://opensea.io/collection/miladybitch\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Milady, That B.I.T.C.H.</a>&rsquo;. The collection featured the Miladys in a bootleg &lsquo;Being Internet Time Cute History&rsquo; shirt, an abbreviation for Bi***.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Remilia Collection team also released a companion collection to Milady Maker, <a href=\"https://remilio.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Redacted Remilio Babies</a>, which is meant to be the canonical zoomer little brother to Milady. The collection is made of 10,000 neochibi pfpNFT&#39;s made to expand the Milady Maker paradigm with the introduction of young J.I.T. energy and schizophrenic reactionary aesthetics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Milady ecosystem also encourages an ecosystem of projects from its fan community as long as criteria such as credits are met. This has resulted in community projects from their fanbase, coming up with their own NFT collection or tokens. Some of these fan-made projects include the <a href=\"https://pixeladymaker.net/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Pixelady Marker NFT</a> collection and the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/milady-meme-coin\" target=\"_blank\">Milady Meme Coin</a> (LADYS). While these projects are not launched by the Remilia Collective team, they play a part in the whole ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These fan-made projects have also been known to have some price correlation to the actual NFT collection itself. For example, the price of LADYS skyrocketed after Elon&rsquo;s tweet on Miladys.</p>\r\n",

    "description": "<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is the Doodles NFT Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Doodles is a collection of 10,000 generative pfpNFTs featuring a collection of colorful cartoon characters and backgrounds. Known for its unique color palette and multicolored characters, the Doodles NFT collection is often used as profile pictures on holders&rsquo; social media sites.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The NFt is generated from a combination of 256 traits, and it also features 62 hand-drawn custom Doodles. Launched on 17 October 2021, the Doodles collection had a mint price of 0.123 ETH. Less than four months later (January 2022), the rare &lsquo;Golden Ape&rsquo; Doodle was sold for 1.1 million USD. Being one of the bigger names in the NFT sphere, celebrities like Steve Aoki, Snoop Dogg, and Gary Vee are also holders of the Doodle NFT Collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Doodle Collection was praised for the innovative way it rewarded early community members. When Doodle&rsquo;s Discord group reached 1,000 members, they made the Discord group private. This meant that no new members could join the group until launch and that the members of the Discord group were all given <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/the-whitelist-how-to-get-early-access-to-nft-drops\" target=\"_blank\">whitelists</a>, allowing them to mint the Doodle NFT.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Who Is the Team Behind Doodles?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Doodles NFT Collection was created by Scott Martin, Evan Keast, and Jordan Castro. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/burnttoast\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Martin</a>, who also goes by the pseudonym Burnt Toast, is the artist and co-founder behind the collection, while <a href=\"https://twitter.com/evankeast\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Evan Keast</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/poopie\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jordan Castro</a> are the co-founders of the project.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While Martin&rsquo;s main expertise is in the design field, both Keast and Castro have already worked with prominent NFT projects prior to the launch of Doodles. Evan Keast, who goes by the name Tulip, has worked with Dapper Labs, a prominent team that helped successfully launch both the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-flow-blockchain\" target=\"_blank\">Flow Blockchain</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/beginners-guide-to-cryptokitties\" target=\"_blank\">CryptoKitties</a> NFT collection. Castro, who goes by the name Poopie, had also worked with CryptoKitties prior to founding Doodles.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is the Utility of the Doodles Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Holders of the Doodles collection are given exclusive access to events and access to the Doodles ecosystem. During the events, Doodles NFT holders also get to interact with other holders and sometimes even join meet-and-greets with the Doodles team themselves.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Holding a Doodle NFT also gives the owners the right to vote on things that affect the Doodles ecosystem. This can include the team&rsquo;s plan to launch new products or even donations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Moving forward, The NFT Doodles collection <a href=\"https://twitter.com/doodles/status/1541614790862323712\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">aims</a> to become &ldquo;one of the world&rsquo;s leading producers of media and entertainment&rdquo; through having different partnerships such as music and gaming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Doodles\" src=\"//s3.amazonaws.com/assets.coingecko.com/app/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/7518/content_Doodles.png\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 675px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In January 2023, the Doodles team <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/web3/2023/01/23/nft-collection-doodles-acquires-emmy-nominated-animation-studio/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">acquired</a> an Emmy-nominated animation studio &lsquo;Golden Wolf&rsquo; and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/poopie/status/1617518255366897668\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tweeted</a> that the community should expect &ldquo;storytelling without constraints &amp; AI animation generation R&amp;D&rdquo;. In March 2023, Castro, one of the co-founders, sent a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DegenerateNews/status/1636269938620129281\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">message</a> in their Discord informing the community that they have been moving towards becoming an entertainment company and are &ldquo;no longer an NFT project&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While some supported the move from being an NFT project to an entertainment company, the move also caused some <a href=\"https://decrypt.co/123782/doodles-no-longer-nft-project-speculators\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">outrage</a> among Doodles holders and the community. Some saw it as the team trying to become a business, neglecting the NFT community.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The Doodles Ecosystem</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Other than the Doodles NFT collection, the team also produces official expansions to give away to Doodles Holders. One such expansion is the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/space-doodles\" target=\"_blank\">Space Doodles NFT collection</a>, which functions as &ldquo;spaceships for your Doodle&rdquo;. This means that through the smart contract functions, Space Doodles will wrap your Doodles from the original collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The team also launched the Doodles 2 collection. Consisting of 24,000 <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/dynamic-nfts-dnfts\" target=\"_blank\">dynamic NFTs</a>, the new collection is <a href=\"https://flow.com/post/flow-blockchain-doodles-2-announcement\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">built on the Flow Blockchain</a>, which will include customizable traits, a dynamic rarity on their NFTs, and a community-driven development system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This means that in the Doodles 2 collection, NFT holders will be able to dress and customize their Doodles 2 NFTs up based on the wearables that they have, which in term will change the rarity of the NFT. As of July 2023, Doodles 2 is still waiting for its beta stage and has not been officially launched yet, and users are only able to purchase and open a <a href=\"https://home.doodles.app/genesis-box\" target=\"_blank\">Genesis box </a>or <a href=\"https://www.doodles.app/pharrell-pack\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Pharrell Pack</a>, which contains the wearables for the system.</p>\r\n",

    "description": "<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is the Azuki NFT Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Azuki is a collection of 10,000 unique pfpNFTs featuring generative avatar NFTs inspired by anime-style artwork. Commonly used as profile pictures in the community, the Azuki collection has a distinct art style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Launched on 12 January 2022, the NFT collection had a mint price of 1 ETH. The Azuki mint was set up in a Dutch Auction style, with the price of the mint decreasing every 20 minutes by 0.05 ETH till it reached the floor price of 0.15 ETH. However, as the collection was sold out within 4 minutes, all 8,700 NFTs available for the mint were sold for a price of 1 ETH. An unspecified number out of the remaining NFTs were minted through the private <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/the-whitelist-how-to-get-early-access-to-nft-drops\" target=\"_blank\">whitelist</a> sale, which was sold at 0.5 ETH each.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">According to the <a href=\"http://azuki.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>, Azuki aims to be more than just a simple pfpNFT project, but rather a brand for the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-metaverse-crypto-blockchain-nft-game\" target=\"_blank\">metaverse</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Who Is the Team Behind Azuki?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Azuki was created by Chiru Labs, a Los-Angelos-based team that consists of artists and developers &ndash; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/2pmflow\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2pm.flow</a>,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/locationtba\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> location tba</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hoshiboyzen\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">HoshiBoy</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ZAGABOND\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Zagabond</a>. The Azuki team faced backlash when Zagabond was named as one of the project&rsquo;s co-founders, as he had allegedly abandoned 3 different NFT projects previously. Zagabond has since apologized and mentioned that he is committed to &ldquo;stepping up&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is the Utility of the Azuki Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Holding the Azuki NFT gives holders membership access to &lsquo;<a href=\"https://www.azuki.com/en/garden\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Garden</a>&rsquo;. This gives holders exclusive access to streetwear collaborations, early access to future Azuki projects, NFT expansion packs, and member-exclusive events like the Azuki Garden party.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As mentioned, Azuki aims to become a brand for the metaverse, and some investors have speculated that the NFTs could later be used as avatars in-game content.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The Azuki Ecosystem</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Other than the Azuki NFT collection, the team has also produced official expansions to give away to Azuki Holders. One such expansion NFT is the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/beanz-official\" target=\"_blank\">BEANZ Official NFT collection</a>. On the 21st of March 2022, Azuki NFT holders were airdropped the NFT. According to the project&rsquo;s official website, &ldquo;Beanz are a small species that sprouts from the dirt in the garden&rdquo;. The Beanz is a companion expansion as they are meant to be a sidekick to an Azuki.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In January 2023, Azuki announced that the team is working on a gamified metaverse&nbsp;&ndash; <a href=\"https://www.azuki.com/en/world/hilumia\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hilumia</a>. The Hilumia City is an interactive map that teases different 10 locations that will later become unique experiences for the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Azuki collection also consists of the Bobu NFT collection, which is intended to be a governance token, the native token of the Azuki ecosystem. According to the <a href=\"https://www.azuki.com/en/bobu-101\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>, the Bobu NFT will be <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/fractional-nfts\" target=\"_blank\">fractionalized</a> and linked to a holder&rsquo;s Twitter account. The Bobu fractions can be sold to other investors as well.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In June 2023, the team also announced the launch of the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/azuki-elementals\" target=\"_blank\">Azuki NFT Elementals Collection</a>. The collection consists of 20,000 NFTs, which are meant to represent the four domains of the Garden. Out of the 20,000 NFTs, 10,000 were airdropped to attendees at a Las Vegas event, while the remaining 10,000 were to be sold through a Dutch auction. During the auction, Azuki holders were given a 10-minute presale window, followed by another 10-minute window for the Beanz Official NFT collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The initial mint was successful, and all the NFTs were sold out within the presale period. However, after the mint, the team faced backlash as many investors felt that the elementals collection looked too similar to the original collection, causing a potential dilution through an increased supply.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

    "description": "<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is the CyberKongz NFT Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">CyberKongz is a collection of 1,000 pfpNFTs featuring 34x34 pixel&nbsp;images of pixelated gorillas. This collection is known as the Genesis Collection, and the team has since released two other collections &ndash; <a href=\"https://opensea.io/collection/cyberkongz-babies\" target=\"_blank\">Baby CyberKongz</a> and <a href=\"https://opensea.io/collection/cyberkongz-vx\" target=\"_blank\">CyberKongz VX</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Launched on 3 March 2021, the project had a mint price of 0.01 <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\" target=\"_blank\">ETH</a>. At the time of the launch, profile picture NFT projects were considered rare, and the collection drew a lot of interest from NFT enthusiasts who discovered the minting process on OpenSea. The project was fully minted in two days.&nbsp; Just 7 months later, the NFT CyberKongz #445 sold for 208 ETH, which was then equivalent to almost 750,000 USD.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Who Is the Team Behind CyberKongz?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The CyberKongz team has not revealed their identities, and most of them are known by their pseudonyms. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/myoo_ck\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Myoo</a> is the main creator and artist behind the project. The <a href=\"https://www.cyberkongz.com/about\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">team</a> consists of several team members whose roles range from developers to artists.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The Great Kongz Migration</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On 17 April 2021, the CyberKongz NFT collection migrated to a new <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-smart-contracts\" target=\"_blank\">smart contract</a>, which brought in new features such as the breeding of the NFTs, the implementation of the native token <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/banana\" target=\"_blank\">BANANA</a>, and the renaming of the NFTs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is the Utility of the CyberKongz Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To reward early supporters, all holders of the Genesis Cyberkongz collection will be given 10 BANANA a day for the next 10 years. BANANA, the native token of the ecosystem, can be exchanged for money or burnt by holders to customize their own NFT, such as renaming their Kongs or writing a bio. BANANA tokens can also be used to breed CyberKongz.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To breed a Baby CyberKongz, you will need 2 CyberKongz from the Genesis collection and 600 BANANA tokens. Holding a Baby CyberKongz gives holders exclusive access to a members-only Discord server called &lsquo;Wall-St Kongz&rsquo;. The Baby CyberKongz can be used in their Play &amp; Kollect NFT game.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A large sum of the profits from the collection is pumped into donations to help wildlife conservation. For example, in March 2021, 60% of the profits from the mint were donated to Cool Earth and Orangutan Outreach.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The CyberKongz Ecosystem</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While CyberKongz was originally just a 2D PFP NFT project, the CyberKongz ecosystem has grown to be much more intricate &ndash; including 3 different types of collections, the native token BANANA, and a Play &amp; Kollect NFT game.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Other than the Genesis and Baby CyberKongz collection, the team has also released another collection &ndash; CyberKongz VX. Airdropped to Baby CyberKongz, the CyberKongz VX collection is not pixelated but rather in a 2D and 3D format that can be used as avatars for exploring the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/the-sandbox\" target=\"_blank\">SandBox</a> metaverse.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As mentioned, the native token BANANA can be used for the customization and breeding of CyberKongz. Other than customization, BANANA is also a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/governance-tokens\" target=\"_blank\">governance token</a>, and BANANA holders have voting rights over the project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The team has also released a NFT game &ndash; Play &amp; Kollect: Jungle Adventure. The game operates on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-polygon-network-matic-an-ultimate-guide\" target=\"_blank\">Polygon chain</a> in a bid to be more environmentally friendly and reduce gas fees for investors. According to the website, token yield and airdrops will possibly be distributed to investors using the same mechanism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The team is also currently in the midst of working on a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-metaverse-crypto-blockchain-nft-game\" target=\"_blank\">metaverse</a> and a battle royale mini-game named &lsquo;Kongquest&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

    "description": "<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is the DeGods NFT Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">DeGods is a collection of 10,000 pfpNFTs featuring &lsquo;degenerate&rsquo; ancient deities dressed in&nbsp;modern streetwear. The project originally launched on the Solana chain but later <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/06/15/why-degods-nfts-seem-to-be-everywhere/?sh=551596db20de\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> the migration of the DeGods NFT collection to Ethereum in December 2022. This decision was amidst the problems that the Solana chain was facing in 2022. The DeGods project only officially migrated to the Ethereum chain in 2023.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Launched on 8 October 2021, the DeGods collection sold out within 7 seconds and had a mint price of 3 SOL. 11 months later, a DeGods NFT <a href=\"https://solscan.io/tx/2mRHBDnvpRk3c7gsibS5TUabhwnsc4d4LkXevrxgE9FngfDYHhV7AoNeSximeGUZZitwe66MLPvBWWFw5ipjnTTz\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sold</a> for 7033.3 SOL. Widely known for the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DeGodsNFT/status/1519672039962935297?\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">acquisition</a> of a professional basketball team named the &lsquo;Killer 3s&rsquo;, the DeGods NFT project is one of the more notable projects in the NFT space. Celebrities like David Beckham and Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal were also among the holders of the DeGods collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project is also well known for the implementation of a &lsquo;Paper Hand Bitch Tax&rsquo; (PHBT), a tax meant to punish <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/paper-hands-in-crypto\" target=\"_blank\">paper hands</a>, which are known as investors who sell their investment at the first sign of financial turmoil in fear of potential losses. The tax meant there would be a 33.3% tax on the sale if a seller sold their NFT below the mint price of 3 SOL. The idea of a tax was the first of its kind, and it quickly gained visibility and popularity among investors. Despite its popularity, the tax system did not fare well, and on the 1st of January 2022, the team abolished the PHBT system.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Who Is the Team Behind DeGods?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The NFT collection is managed by <a href=\"https://www.dustlabs.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dust Labs</a>, which is also the same team behind the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/y00ts#\" target=\"_blank\">y00ts NFT collection</a> on Polygon. The team is led by Rohun Vora, who went by the pseudonym <a href=\"https://twitter.com/frankdegods\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Frank DeGods</a> before he doxxed himself in November 2022. Rohun is a serial entrepreneur in web3, who was previously pursuing a degree in Film at UCLA but dropped out. Likewise, the CEO of Dust Labs, Kevin DeGods, also doxxed himself and revealed his identity as tech entrepreneur Kevin Henrikson.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is the Utility of the DeGods Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The DeGods NFT collection is known to have one of the strongest NFT communities, with many investors using their DeGods NFTs as profile pictures on social media.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Holders of the DeGods collection are also able to generate <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dust-protocol\" target=\"_blank\">DUST</a> tokens by staking their NFTs. DUST is the native token of the DeDAO, which is a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/daos-community-organizers-of-web3\" target=\"_blank\">decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)</a> that governs the DeGods ecosystem. This allows holders of the DeGods collection to generate some passive income while holding their NFTs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The DUST earned can then be spent on its native marketplace, where investors are able to buy exclusive whitelist spots for upcoming projects, merchandise, courtside tickets, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/blue-chip-nft-projects\" target=\"_blank\">blue-chip NFTs</a>, and even V-Bucks for Fortnite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Holders of the DeGod collection are also given exclusive access to a Discord group, which allows holders of the collection to interact with one another.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">DeadGods</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With the DUST generated from staking their DeGods, DeGods holders were also able to &ldquo;transcend&rdquo; their NFT to a DeadGod. The DeadGods are not a separate collection, as it still contains the metadata of the original DeGods. This essentially means that DeGods and DeadGods are two different versions of the same NFT. By transcending your DeGod to DeadGods, holders can mine more dust when staking their NFTs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Holders of DeadGods were also given an exclusive <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/the-whitelist-how-to-get-early-access-to-nft-drops\" target=\"_blank\">whitelist</a> to mint Dust Lab&rsquo;s other NFT project, y00ts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">DeGods on Bitcoin&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In March 2023, 535 DeGods NFTs were burnt and minted on Bitcoin. This was after the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/bitcoin-ordinals-nft\" target=\"_blank\">Ordinals</a> protocol was introduced in February 2023, allowing users to hold NFTs on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-bitcoin\" target=\"_blank\">Bitcoin blockchain</a>. Of the 535 NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain, 500 of the NFTs were minted with BTC, while the remaining 34 were auctioned or raffled off in DUST.</p>\r\n",

    "description": "<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is the mfers NFT Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Short for motherf***ers, the mfers NFT collection is a pfpNFT collection of 10,021 unique NFTs featuring distinct stickman figures inspired by the popular &lsquo;Are you winning son?&rsquo; meme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Out of the 10,021 NFTs of the mfers collection, 21 of the NFTs are rare and differ significantly from their counterparts. These rare NFTs feature different dialogues and avatars, with some of these NFTs drawing inspiration from popular NFT collections like <a href=\"https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x79fcdef22feed20eddacbb2587640e45491b757f/9547\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BAYC</a> and <a href=\"https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x79fcdef22feed20eddacbb2587640e45491b757f/5688\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CryptoPunks</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Launched on 30 November 2021, the mfers NFT collection had an original mint price of 0.069 ETH. The collection sold out within 10 minutes despite not having done any paid promotions or whitelisting prior to the launch. The mfers NFT collection is also part of the public domain and users are able to use it in any way that they desire.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Who Is Behind mfers?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The mfers NFT collection was created by Sartoshi, a famous NFT influencer and Twitter personality. In 2022, after launching another NFT project titled &lsquo;<a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/end-of-sartoshi\" target=\"_blank\">End of Sartoshi</a>&rsquo;, Sartoshi has since deactivated his Twitter account (previously @sartishi_nft).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In his <a href=\"https://mirror.xyz/sartoshi.eth/VQB_rWveDQuut4GQKcFA6aqL9hM3rS7raYwsW3UfdLA\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a>, Sartoshi announced that he transferred the NFT&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-smart-contracts\" target=\"_blank\">smart contract</a> to the mfers community via the unofficial mfers <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/mpc-wallet-vs-multi-sig-wallets\" target=\"_blank\">multi-sig wallet</a>. Moving forward, 50% of the royalties from the collection will go straight to the multi-sig wallet where the community will be able to decide what to do with the funds. The remaining 50% of royalties will be divided among Sartoshi himself, other developers, and consultants who worked on the project.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The mfers NFT Collection Roadmap</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Despite Sartoshi&rsquo;s early departure from the project, the mfers NFT community has bonded together and formed the mfers decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Through the use of their DAO, the community can vote on the project&rsquo;s direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Other than access to exclusive Discord groups, holders of the mfers NFT collection will also be given access to a 3D MFerverse filled with 3D mfers and new tokens. There have also been many different spinoff NFT collections that are inspired by the mfers collection &ndash; <a href=\"https://opensea.io/collection/mfers-in-paradise\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">mfers in paradise</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/ape-mfers\" target=\"_blank\">ape mfers</a>, and many more. The team is also working on expanding their project, such as a merchandise store, an inspired book, and even songs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

This gives Panda holders access to high-profile events such as concerts, sports events, networking events, meet-and-greets with celebrities, poker tournaments, and much more.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2023 alone, the Kanpai Pandas team has already more than 40 <a href=\"https://kanpaipandas.io/events\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">events</a> lined up for their holders. This includes real-world events like access to a suite in the Allegiant Stadium for Beyonce&rsquo;s Renaissance World Tour in Las Vegas.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to access to exclusive events, the Kanpai team has also teased the release of new artwork collections, exclusive merchandise and airdrops for Kanpai Pandas NFT holders.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The Kanpai Pandas Ecosystem</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Other than the original collection, the team has also released another NFT collection titled <a href=\"https://opensea.io/collection/kanpai-pandas-infinity-collection\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kanpai Pandas Infinity Collection.</a> Kanpai Pandas Infinity is a collection of 250 unique NFTs that was an exclusive mint for Kanpai Pandas holders who accumulated 1 Panda on each of the 6 chains &ndash; Ethereum, BNB, AVAX, Arbitrum, Polygon, and Optimism.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While the Kanpai Pandas Infinity collection still retains resemblance to the original collection, the collection has their own set of unique traits &ndash; such as brighter and more dynamic backgrounds, and a custom soundtrack.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project also has its own proprietary point system, <a href=\"https://kanpai-labs.gitbook.io/kp-docs/panda-point-mechanics\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Panda Points</a>, where users can earn points depending on the NFT&rsquo;s rarity score. These points can then be used to purchase new traits from the Panda Lab marketplace, and overall increase the rarity of their Panda NFT. Holders can also spend their points within their own in-app games like Kanpai Casino, Kanpai Gaming, or spend their points to join bounties and raffles within the <a href=\"https://kanpai-labs.gitbook.io/kp-docs/ppdex\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Panda Points DEX</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2022, the team also launched their &lsquo;Fantasy Sports&rsquo; initiative, where holders are able to compete in online games like World Cup Fantasy or Fantasy NFL during the seasons. The winners of these Fantasy games were awarded prizes like Super Bowl tickets, cash, and Panda NFTs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Moving forward, the Kanpai Pandas team is currently working on making retail products, a comic/ animation series, and more ways to reach the non-native crypto users.&nbsp;</p>",

    "description": "After more than a century in circulation, the penny has become both a worthless relic of inflation and a prized collector's item. The last copper pennies were minted in 1982, after which they have been struck in zinc. A penny from any given year will always be worth exactly 1¢, according to the US Treasury, but the copper in pre-1982 pennies has a metal value of approximately 3¢. Recognizing these discrepancies in value, Rutherford Chang removed 10,000 copper coins from circulation and archivally documented them. The final state of these 10,000 copper cents are inscribed on 10,000 satoshis, while the physical coins are smelted and cast into a solid 68-pound copper block. This metal block is rendered as a three-dimensional digital model and inscribed as a 4-megabyte ordinal, comprising the entirety of Bitcoin block #839969. As the traditional penny fades into irrelevance and its production is ultimately terminated, its value can continue to be redefined. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"//rutherfordchang.com/cents\">rutherfordchang.com/cents</a>",

Originally planned to be launched on the Ethereum blockchain, the team later decided to switch chains over to Solana making it more accessible for the masses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project places a significant emphasis on helping the less fortunate and as of 30 August 2023, the project has already donated more than 750 SOL to various charities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Who Is the Team Behind the Famous Fox Federation?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/draxxts\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DraxxTs</a> is the co-founder of the Famous Fox NFT collection and an avid investor in cryptocurrency and NFTs. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FoxyDev42\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">FoxyDev</a>&nbsp;is the lead developer , and the rest of the team consists of individuals from different backgrounds, handling development, social media management, moderation, strategic partnerships, and art.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is the Utility of the Famous Fox Federation Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Other than access to the project&rsquo;s holders-only Discord channel and community, Famous Fox NFT holders are able to enjoy free access to their internal tools like <a href=\"https://famousfoxes.com/wallpaper\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Wallpaper Maker </a>and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://famous-fox-federation.gitbook.io/famous-fox-federation/utilities/banner-builder\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Banner Builder</a>.

While this collection is also able to participate in staking and has the same rarity as the Genesis collection, they will only receive a quarter of FOXY rewards that the Genesis collection would receive.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The honorary collection, the Famous Fox Friends &amp; Foes NFT collection consists of 1/1 NFTs that are auctioned off for FOXY regularly. These NFTs are created by various guest artists and earn holders 100 FOXY daily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The last collection, Famous Fox Dens NFTs is a metaverse collection of 3,000 NFTs Dens which serves as an ownership key to their Dens &ndash; rooms in the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-metaverse-crypto-blockchain-nft-game\" target=\"_blank\">metaverse</a> that can be decorated and customized.

    "description": "<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is the Okay Bears NFT Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Okay Bears is a collection of 10,000 pfpNFTs featuring unique bears wearing modern clothes. Known for having a welcoming community, the Okay Bears project has an uplifting and positive motto &ndash; &lsquo;We&rsquo;re all gonna be okay.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Launched on 26 April 2022, the project had a mint price of 1.5 <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/solana\" target=\"_blank\">SOL</a>. On the day of the mint, the Okay Bears had already generated almost 18 million dollars in secondary sales. This was a record for any Solana NFT project, making the Okay Bears project one of the most sought-after NFT projects in the space.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From the beginning, the Okay Bears project was centered around exclusivity. To gain invite-only access to the exclusive Discord channel, users had to follow specific instructions, such as changing their profile pictures. Even after joining the Discord channel, members still had to vie for a spot on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/the-whitelist-how-to-get-early-access-to-nft-drops\" target=\"_blank\">whitelist</a>, making the project extremely elusive and hyped.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Who Is the Team Behind Okay Bears?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Okay Bears NFT collection was co-founded by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kaisisokay\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kais</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/suby_sol\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Suby</a>. While Kais has an extensive background in graphic design, art history, and branding, Suby comes from an engineering background and has experience leading NFT collection projects for established international teams. The rest of the Okay Bears <a href=\"https://www.okaybears.com/park\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">team</a> consists of individuals from diverse backgrounds, including artists, developers, engineering, and even an educator.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is the Utility of the Okay Bears Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Holders of the Okay Bears NFT collection are granted full access to the Okay Bears ecosystem virtual community. Holders are also granted early access to any new projects, collaborations, or events that the Okay Bears Team may release in the future. These can include any possible new NFT collection, member-only merchandise, exclusive live events, and metaverse experiences.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In line with Okay Bears&rsquo; positive motto, Okay Bears <a href=\"https://www.okaybears.com/okay-cares\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">claim</a> to &ldquo;represent a culture shift in charitable fundraising, using NFTs for positive community impact and global change for good&rdquo;. The project has partnered with 4 different charity programs to give back to the community &ndash; including <a href=\"https://www.okaybears.com/red\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">RED</a>, <a href=\"https://www.okaybears.com/okay-cares-2/unhcr\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">UNHCR</a>, <a href=\"https://www.okaybears.com/okay-cares-2/movember\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Movember</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.okaybears.com/okay-cares-2/heir-lonzo-ball\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Heir &amp; Lonzo Ball</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Okay Bears team has also previously announced plans to create a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-metaverse-crypto-blockchain-nft-game\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">metaverse</a> for holders of the NFT collection.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The Okay Bears Ecosystem</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Okay Bears team has created an elaborate blueprint map that explains the vision for the NFT project. The blueprint includes 7 spaces &ndash; The Park, Bear Market, Studio, Workshop, Gallery, Boutique, and Platform.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Okay Bears Blueprint\" src=\"//s3.amazonaws.com/assets.coingecko.com/app/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/7548/content_Okay_Bears.png\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 611px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &lsquo;Bear Market&rsquo;, built exclusively for Okay Bears NFT holders, includes an ecosystem of web3, web2, and IRL sales channels. This includes a &lsquo;BEAR MARKET X MAGIC EDEN&rsquo; partnership, where Okay Bears holders can&nbsp;buy and sell Okay Bears on Magic Eden with special member-only perks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &lsquo;Studio&rsquo;, also built exclusively for Okay Bears NFT holders, gives holders early access to any new projects the Okay Bears Team may release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As mentioned, &lsquo;The Park&rsquo; is a Discord server likened to a digital meeting space for the Okay Bears community.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The &lsquo;Workshop&rsquo; consists of public awareness projects and community engagement to boost visibility for the Okay Bears NFT projects. This is done through outdoor advertising and collaborations with big brands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The &lsquo;Gallery&rsquo; is made to showcase Okay Bear NFT holders and their fan art. This includes a section on a curated fan art display, with an emphasis on the artists and their communities. The Gallery also includes real-life NFT art exhibitions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The &lsquo;Boutique&rsquo; includes merchandise and collections. Through a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/token-gating\" target=\"_blank\">token-gated</a> shop, NFT holders are able to claim a complimentary physical welcome pack. The shop also includes some exclusive holders-only merchandise and collaborations with other fashion brands to boost awareness.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Last but not least, the blueprint also includes the &lsquo;Platform&rsquo;, which includes information about keynotes, conferences, and meetups of the NFT community. This also includes exclusive meetups for holders of Okay Bears.&nbsp;</p>",

    "description": "Art Blocks Collection: Curated\r\n\r\nHeritage Art Blocks Collection: Curated series 4\r\n\r\nProject Description: “Fragments of an infinite field” is a compositional system in which an idealized plant species is generated and arranged in a potentially infinite field of foliage. The main environmental parameter of the composition is the determination of a season of the year. The season determines the landscape’s colors and defines specific phenomena for each of them, such as rain in summer, snow in winter, petals falling in autumn, and pollen in spring. The flower has several possible variables, which can be macro aspects, affecting the entire population of the species, or micro, affecting each individual of the species differently. For example, the number of petals can be equal in all individuals or not. The number of filaments and other structures of the flower can undergo minor deviations, generating small mutations. The confusion between the figure (plant) and the background (earth, sky, other natural elements) is fascinating from a compositional point of view. The background colors are, most of the time, colors present in the figures, often breaking the boundary between them and, therefore, generating chromatic masses. In this project I also intend to research the following question: How to create parameters that resemble a living organism's growth? In this sense, the project approaches digital morphogenesis and the development of procedural organisms.",

    "description": "<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is the CryptoPunks NFT Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">CryptoPunks is an Ethereum-based NFT collection of 10,000 unique art characters. Out of the 10,000 Punks &ndash;&nbsp;there are 6,039 males, 3,840 females, 88 zombies, 24 apes, and 9 alien punks. Due to their rarity, the zombie, ape, and alien punks are priced&nbsp;significantly higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The CryptoPunks collection is one of the earliest and most popular collections in the NFT space, with some high-profile celebrities owning their own Punk. Some of these celebrities include Serena Williams, Logan Paul, Mark Cuban, and SnoopDogg. The CryptoPunks NFT collection was so highly sought after by art collectors that they were even sold at Sotheby&#39;s and Christie&#39;s, which are international auction houses.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Launched in June 2017, 9,000 of the 10,000 NFTs were free for mint, while the other remaining 1,000 NFTs were held by Larva Labs. Four years later, by 2021, the same NFTs were sold for millions of dollars.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The CryptoPunks NFT collection was algorithmically generated by a pixelated character generator that assigned each individual character their unique traits. The algorithm ensures that no two NFTs in the collection are the same, making each of them unique. Generally speaking, the CryptoPunks that do not have many unique features have a lower floor price.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Who Is the Team Behind CryptoPunks?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The NFT collection was actually released as an experiment by two Canadian software developers from Larva Labs studio. At the time of the release, the ERC-721 token standard did not exist, and the two software developers, Matt Hall&nbsp;and John Watkinson, released the CryptoPunks collection as an experiment as custom contract NFTs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">According to the team, the CryptoPunks collection drew inspiration from the 1970s London Punk scene, the sci-fi cyberpunk movement, the popular movie Blade Runner, and the book Neuromancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2022, the team behind Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT, Yuga Labs, acquired CryptoPunks along with <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/meebits\" target=\"_blank\">Meebits</a>, another popular NFT collection. Now that they own three of the most popular NFT collections in the NFT space, Yuga Labs has established itself as a big player in the NFT space.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is the Utility of the CryptoPunks Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Being a holder of the CryptoPunks NFT collection gives holders exclusive access to member-only events where users are required to hold a CryptoPunk NFT to participate. This helps holders to interact with other holders and get access to new features. Having been one of the pioneers in the NFT space, the CryptoPunks collection has built up a pretty strong sense of community. As such, some holders actually purchase the CryptoPunks NFT to gain access to the community and new releases.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As the CrytoPunks collection is one of the most iconic and popular in the NFT space, the CryptoPunk NFTs are also often regarded as a symbol of prestige and wealth. Therefore, oftentimes many owners of the CryptoPunks NFT collection will use their NFT as their profile picture or avatar on social media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some of the owners will also <a href=\"https://decrypt.co/77872/cryptopunk-owners-have-new-way-make-money-renting-out-their-avatars\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rent their NFTs</a> out or use their CryptoPunks collection as collateral to <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/blur-and-blend-nft-marketplace\" target=\"_blank\">borrow ETH</a>. This is part of Blur&rsquo;s lending program, Blend, where users are able to borrow and lend NFTs through a peer-to-peer platform.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As the NFT space continues to grow, it is likely that the utility of the NFT collection will continue to expand.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What makes CryptoPunks special?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The CryptoPunks collection is known for its culture significance in the history of Ethereum and NFT. It is touted as the first <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/glossary/pfp\">PFP</a> project and sometimes the first NFT collection that managed to retain its value.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Wrapped CryptoPunks&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Wrapped CryptoPunks NFT collection is a derivative of the original CryptoPunks NFT collection. As mentioned earlier, the CryptoPunks NFT collections are made on a custom contract. This means that they are only available to be traded on the Ethereum chain.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When you wrap your CryptoPunk, it is essentially changing your NFT to an ERC-721 token standard, which is currently used to power most of the NFTs we see today. This allows your wrapped CryptoPunks to be used in other decentralized applications besides Ethereum.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The wrapping process is reversible, and NFT holders are able to wrap and unwrap their CryptoPunks at will. However, it is important to note that the process to wrap the CryptoPunks NFT includes interacting with smart contracts via etherscan.io and that failure to complete all the steps correctly can result in a loss of the NFT.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

    "description": "<h3>What Is the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bored Ape Yacht Club is a collection of 10,000 unique Bored Ape NFTs, which showcase a series of apes with different characteristics and expressions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Often the face of NFTs, the BAYC collection is one of the most well-known NFT collections, with many celebrities holding the collection. Some of these celebrities include Justin Bieber, Eminem, Serena Williams, Stephen Curry, Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal, and Jimmy Fallon. Celebrities and investors were not the only ones interested in the collection, even big corporate companies like Adidas purchased their own Ape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Launched in April 2021, the project was available for mint at 0.08 ETH and was sold out within 12 hours. Less than 2 years later, the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/10-most-expensive-nfts-ever-sold\" target=\"_blank\">most expensive ape</a> was sold at an astounding 3.4 Million USD.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Who Is the Team Behind BAYC?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The NFT project was created by Yuga Labs, a team of four individuals who preferred to use their online pseudonyms and only later revealed their identities to the public. The team consists of Greg Solana (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/CryptoGarga\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Gargamel</a>), Wyle Aronow (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/GordonGoner\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Gordon Goner</a>), Kerem (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/TomatoBAYC\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Emperor Tomato Ketchup</a>), and Zesham (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/SassBAYC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1491151597682180096%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnet.com%2Fhow-to%2Fbored-ape-yacht-club-nfts-everything-you-need-to-know%2F\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">No Sass</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The artists that designed the BAYC collection are <a href=\"https://www.allseeingseneca.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Seneca</a>, Thomas Dagley, Migwashere, and other artists who, to this day, choose to remain anonymous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2022, the team behind BAYC, Yuga Labs, also acquired 2 popular NFT collections &ndash; <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/cryptopunks\" target=\"_blank\">CryptoPunks</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/meebits\" target=\"_blank\">Meebits</a>, establishing themselves as big players in the NFT space.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What Is the Utility of the BAYC Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Being a holder of the BAYC collection doubles as a membership card and grants exclusive access to holders. Holding an Ape also allows the owners commercial and branding rights to their NFTs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BAYC holders are granted exclusive access to &lsquo;THE BATHROOM&rsquo; and a private Discord server. &lsquo;THE BATHROOM&rsquo; is a collaborative community board where holders are able to draw pixels at intervals of 15 minutes. The Discord server allows BAYC holders to interact with other holders and get access to new features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BAYC holders are also granted access to the Yuga Lab&rsquo;s projects. This will include other NFT collections and the BAYC metaverse (Otherside).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Bored Ape Yacht Club Ecosystem</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-apecoin-ape-ecosystem\" target=\"_blank\">BAYC ecosystem</a>, the team also launched its own native token, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/apecoin\" target=\"_blank\">Apecoin</a>, several spin-off NFT collections, and its own <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-metaverse-crypto-blockchain-nft-game\" target=\"_blank\">metaverse</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Launched in March 2022, Yuga Labs released their native token APE, which functions as a governance token. This ERC-20 token APE allows holders to execute transactions, make governing decisions, and participate in the ecosystem. During the launch, a portion of the token supply was airdropped to BAYC and MAYC owners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yuga Labs also launched spin-off collections such as the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/mutant-ape-yacht-club\" target=\"_blank\">Mutant Ape Yacht Club</a> (MAYC) and the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/bored-ape-kennel-club\" target=\"_blank\">Bored Ape Kennel Club</a> (BAKC). In August 2021, Yuga Labs airdropped BAYC holders a &ldquo;mutant serum&rdquo;. With the serum, BAYC holders were able to mutate or mint their own Bored Ape into a Mutant Ape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In July 2021, BAYC holders were airdropped the BAKC collection. The BAKC collection functions as a companion collection in a bid to reward BAYC holders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The BAYC ecosystem also consists of the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/otherdeed-for-otherside\" target=\"_blank\">Otherside Metaverse</a>. While the metaverse is still currently under development, when completed, the metaverse will be a virtual world where their NFTs can be used as playable characters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In September 2023, Yuga Labs announced the launch of a new game, Legend of the Mara (LotM), a collection-based 2D strategy game. The game is a sub-universe within the broader Otherside metaverse game.</p>\r\n",

The motto behind the NFT collection is &ldquo;spreading good vibes across the meta.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Launched on 22 July 2021, the Pudgy Penguin collection sold out within <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pudgypenguins/status/1420430560405643273?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">19 minutes</a> and had an original mint price of 0.3 ETH. Just a week later, the floor price of the collection had already increased to 2.4 ETH. On the 13 of August 2022, the rarest Pudgy (#6873) was sold for 400 ETH.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Who Is the Team Behind Pudgy Penguins?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Pudgy Penguins were originally founded by a team of 4 college students &ndash;&nbsp; Mrtubby, Mickyj, Jonah, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ColeThereum\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cole</a>. However, the team allegedly was <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/07/pudgy-penguins-nft-project-ousts-founders-as-mood-turns-icy/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">not able to follow their initial promises</a> to the community, such as launching a children&#39;s book and a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-metaverse-crypto-blockchain-nft-game\" target=\"_blank\">metaverse</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In April 2022, the Pudgy Penguin NFT collection was acquired by Luca Netz (Luca Schnetzle) for $2.5 million. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LucaNetz\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Luca Netz</a> is a well-known Los Angeles entrepreneur, and along with his team, have since worked hard to rebrand the collection.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Currently, the Pudgy Penguin <a href=\"https://pudgypenguins.com/about-us\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">team</a> consists of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/0xLoMel\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lorenzo Melendez</a> (CTO), Nicholas Ravid (CMO), <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chefgoyardi\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Lobanov</a> (CCO), <a href=\"https://twitter.com/empathyandip\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jennifer Mcglone</a> (CLO), and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drkaizu\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Kaizu</a> (Head Of Operations).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is the Utility of the Pudgy Penguins Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Holders of Pudgy Penguins are known as &ldquo;Pengus&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Huddle,&rdquo; and they are given access to a number of exclusive benefits such as exclusive events and experiences.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pudgy Penguin holders get exclusive access to exclusive events, such as meetups, parties, and concerts. These meetups, which are usually held in major cities around the world, allow holders to interact with other holders, building a strong supportive community.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pudgy holders are also able to license and use their penguins for marketing purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The Pudgy Penguins Ecosystem</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Other than the Pudgy Penguin NFT collection, the team also produces official expansions to give away to Pudgy Holders.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One such expansion is the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/lilpudgys\" target=\"_blank\">Lil Pudgy NFT collection </a>which was introduced in December 2021. The Lil Pudgy is a collection of 22,222 NFTs, of which 8,888 were given complimentary to Pudgy Penguin holders, and the remaining 13,334 were sold in a public sale. According to the website, the Lil Pudgys collection is of northern descent and are allies in the fight against the evil bears of negativity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In January 2023, the Lil Pudgy NFT collection announced a partnership with <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-layerzero-interoperability\" target=\"_blank\">LayerZero</a>, which enabled cross-chain functionality, allowing Lil Pudgy NFTs to travel across different chains such as Polygon, the BNB Smart Chain, and Arbitrum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pudgy holders were also able to claim the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/pudgyrods\" target=\"_blank\">Pudgy Rod NFT collection</a> for free. The Pudgy Rod NFT collection is meant to be a companion collection of fishing rods that the Pudgys would use. However, during the reveal of the NFTs, the community was disappointed, and the founders faced negative backlash.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On 18 May 2023, the team announced the release of physical Pudgy Penguin merchandise, which was based on the Pudgy Penguins IP.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Social Media Presence&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Pudgy Penguin collection also has an impressive social media presence apart from the typical NFT collector audience. On <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/pudgypenguins/?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>, the Pudgy Penguin collection posts a series of cute short videos and encouraging posts, which has garnered the project a massive following of 696K followers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The same can be said of its <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@pudgypenguins?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Tiktok</a> account, which has garnered 1.7 million likes and 67K followers, from its short-form video content. While these videos and posts are not necessarily related to the NFT sphere, they give the Pudgy Penguins a personality, increasing the visibility of the project.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The team consists of Greg Solana (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/CryptoGarga\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Gargamel</a>), Wyle Aronow (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/GordonGoner\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Gordon Goner</a>), Kerem (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/TomatoBAYC\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Emperor Tomato Ketchup</a>), and Zesham (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/SassBAYC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1491151597682180096%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnet.com%2Fhow-to%2Fbored-ape-yacht-club-nfts-everything-you-need-to-know%2F\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">No Sass</a>).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2022, the team behind MAYC, Yuga Labs, also acquired 2 popular NFT collections &ndash; <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/cryptopunks\" target=\"_blank\">CryptoPunks</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/meebits\" target=\"_blank\">Meebits</a>, establishing themselves as major players in the NFT space.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is the Utility of the MAYC Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While the purpose of the collection was to expand the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-apecoin-ape-ecosystem\" target=\"_blank\">BAYC ecosystem</a> and reward the existing holders of BAYC, the holders of the MAYC collection enjoy the same benefits as BAYC holders.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Being a holder of the MAYC NFT collection doubles as a membership card and grants exclusive access to holders. Holding an Ape also allows the owners commercial and branding rights to their NFTs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MAYC holders are granted exclusive access to &lsquo;THE BATHROOM&rsquo; and a private Discord server. &lsquo;THE BATHROOM&rsquo; is a collaborative community board where holders are able to draw pixels at intervals of 15 minutes. The Discord server allows other BAYC and MAYC holders to interact with other holders and get access to new features.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">MAYC holders are also granted access to the Yuga Lab&rsquo;s projects. This will include other NFT collections and the BAYC metaverse (Otherside).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The Bored Ape Yacht Club Ecosystem&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As part of the ecosystem, the team also launched its own native token, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/apecoin\" target=\"_blank\">Apecoin</a>, several spin-off NFT collections, and its own metaverse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Launched in March 2022, Yuga Labs released their native token APE, which functions as a governance token. This ERC-20 token APE allows holders to execute transactions, make governing decisions, and participate in the ecosystem. During the launch, a portion of the token supply was airdropped to BAYC and MAYC owners.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yuga Labs also launched another spin-off collection &ndash;&nbsp;the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/bored-ape-kennel-club\" target=\"_blank\">Bored Ape Kennel Club</a> (BAKC). In July 2021, BAYC holders were airdropped the BAKC collection. The BAKC collection functions as a companion collection in a bid to reward BAYC holders.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The BAYC ecosystem also consists of the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/otherdeed-for-otherside\" target=\"_blank\">Otherside Metaverse</a>. While the metaverse is still currently under development, when completed, the metaverse will be a virtual world where their NFTs can be used as playable characters.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The first of its kind, xNFTs refer to executable NFTs, which contain embedded executable scripts. This means that, unlike regular NFTs, xNFTs contain code that gives the holder ownership rights over its execution.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On 20 April 2023, minting for the Mad Lads NFT collection went live and sold out within minutes. At launch, the project had a mint price of 6.9 SOL. Less than a week later, one of these NFT <a href=\"https://solscan.io/tx/24XETqkWVhAeypeX5Rx24cXXScqUxV6jQ8GRVpSNNB69VUwRLTjAzjHct5EP7w5zyp6kW66EhFAnQvAcPuaUZkjg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sold</a> for 3625 SOL, amounting to $74,742.08 USD.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Being the first xNFT in the space, the project was extremely hyped and the team had to delay the mint date due to overwhelming traffic. Being extremely hyped, the Mad Lads NFT project has been credited for the <a href=\"https://ambcrypto.com/mad-lads-comes-to-the-rescue-of-solanas-ailing-nft-landscape-details-inside/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">revitalization of Solana NFTs</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Who Is the Team Behind Mad Lads?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Mad Lads NFT project was created by <a href=\"https://www.coral.community/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Coral</a>, a framework development company on the Solana blockchain. When the Mad Labs NFT collection launched, the only supported wallet for the xNFT was <a href=\"https://www.backpack.app/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Backpack</a>, which was also owned by Coral.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Coral was co-founded by Armani Ferrante and Tristan Yver. Ferrante, who is currently the CEO of Coral, has an extensive background in software engineering. The CTO of Coral, Yver is a blockchain developer who also took on the role of lead developer for the Mad Lads NFT collection.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is the Utility of the Mad Lads Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As mentioned, as the Mad Lads collection are executable NFTs, this unlocks a whole range of features of holders as xNFTs are able to interact with other Web3 applications. This can include a wide range of utilities, such as integration into Web3 games or decentralized applications.</p>\r\n",

    "description": "<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What is the Milady Maker NFT collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Milady Maker is a collection of 10,000 generative pfpNFTs in a neochibi aesthetic inspired by street-style tribes. This means that the NFT collection was meant to be profile pictures inspired by a specific anime art style.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Launched in March 2021, the collection had a mint price of 0.05 ETH. Used frequently among Twitter memes, the floor price of the collection was already at 0.2 ETH by the end of 2021. In May 2023, Elon Musk shared a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1656326406618619910\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Milady meme</a> on Twitter, causing the project price to skyrocket further, with some speculating that Elon owned his own Milady NFT.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To this day, Milady is still used frequently in Twitter memes as reaction pictures. During Binance&rsquo;s 2023 Annual Awards, they announced Milady as the &lsquo;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BSCNews/status/1679877997216530436\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NFT Project of the Year</a>&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Who Is the Team Behind Milady?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Milady collection was created by Remilia Collective, the same team behind the companion NFT collection &lsquo;<a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/redacted-remilio-babies\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Redacted Remilio Babies</a>&rsquo;. While the team behind the Milady collection is anonymous, the CEO of Miladys self-doxxed herself, revealing herself as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CharlotteFang77\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Miya</a>, a controversial 4chan internet personality.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, due to the backlash faced by the community following her self-doxx, Miya, also known as Charlotte Fang, has since stepped down as CEO of the company.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What is the Utility of the Milady Collection?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Milady Maker NFT collection has a number of utilities. While the NFT collection is meant to be used as profile pictures, Milady also labels itself as an aesthetic, a lifestyle, and a community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milady NFT holders are given exclusive access to certain events and benefits. This includes the Milady VRtube, Raves, Bootlegs, and a Minecraft Metaverse.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Milady VRtube is a service that allows Milady holders to use their NFTs as an avatar for calls and live-streaming platforms via the <a href=\"https://www.hologram.xyz/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hologram application</a>. This is slightly similar to Apple&rsquo;s Memoji work, as users can pose as their own Memoji avatar in calls.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Milady holders are also given exclusive access to physical raves. These raves are party meetups that take place with local underground scenes such as NYC and Tokyo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Milady Bootlegs is a merchandise store that sells designer knockoffs with Milady logos. These allow the community and its holders to show their love and support for the collection.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Milady holders are also given exclusive access to the Milady Minecraft server. In the server, there are several special features, such as land plots and events, that are only made available for NFT holders. This allows and encourages the interaction between the community and NFT holders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Other than that, the Milady collection has also been known to help raise money for charity. In December 2021, the team supposedly&nbsp;donated 1 ETH to Save the Children.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What is the Drip Score System Within the Milady Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Each individual Milady NFT has a drip score rating the overall aesthetic value and stylishness of the NFT.&nbsp; To calculate the NFT&rsquo;s drip score, each cosmetic is scored on its rarity, then weighted against the prominence of its slot, with a multiplier applied for theme or costume complete badges. The Miladys are each given a letter grade for their drip score. The ratings range from D, C, B, A, S, and SS.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The Milady Ecosystem</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Other than the Milady NFT collection, the Remilia Collective team also sometimes produces official expansions to give away to Milady Holders. One such expansion is a <a href=\"https://miladymaker.net/banners/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Generative NFT Banner</a> that was a free mint for Milady Holders. The <a href=\"https://opensea.io/collection/banners-nft\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Generative NFT banner </a>mint was made in collaboration with community-submitted captions on places such as Wikipedia user pages and forum signatures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another free mint that was given to Milady holders is the NFT collection named &lsquo;<a href=\"https://opensea.io/collection/miladybitch\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Milady, That B.I.T.C.H.</a>&rsquo;. The collection featured the Miladys in a bootleg &lsquo;Being Internet Time Cute History&rsquo; shirt, an abbreviation for Bi***.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Remilia Collection team also released a companion collection to Milady Maker, <a href=\"https://remilio.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Redacted Remilio Babies</a>, which is meant to be the canonical zoomer little brother to Milady. The collection is made of 10,000 neochibi pfpNFT&#39;s made to expand the Milady Maker paradigm with the introduction of young J.I.T. energy and schizophrenic reactionary aesthetics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Milady ecosystem also encourages an ecosystem of projects from its fan community as long as criteria such as credits are met. This has resulted in community projects from their fanbase, coming up with their own NFT collection or tokens. Some of these fan-made projects include the <a href=\"https://pixeladymaker.net/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Pixelady Marker NFT</a> collection and the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/milady-meme-coin\" target=\"_blank\">Milady Meme Coin</a> (LADYS). While these projects are not launched by the Remilia Collective team, they play a part in the whole ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These fan-made projects have also been known to have some price correlation to the actual NFT collection itself. For example, the price of LADYS skyrocketed after Elon&rsquo;s tweet on Miladys.</p>\r\n",

    "description": "<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is the Doodles NFT Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Doodles is a collection of 10,000 generative pfpNFTs featuring a collection of colorful cartoon characters and backgrounds. Known for its unique color palette and multicolored characters, the Doodles NFT collection is often used as profile pictures on holders&rsquo; social media sites.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The NFt is generated from a combination of 256 traits, and it also features 62 hand-drawn custom Doodles. Launched on 17 October 2021, the Doodles collection had a mint price of 0.123 ETH. Less than four months later (January 2022), the rare &lsquo;Golden Ape&rsquo; Doodle was sold for 1.1 million USD. Being one of the bigger names in the NFT sphere, celebrities like Steve Aoki, Snoop Dogg, and Gary Vee are also holders of the Doodle NFT Collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Doodle Collection was praised for the innovative way it rewarded early community members. When Doodle&rsquo;s Discord group reached 1,000 members, they made the Discord group private. This meant that no new members could join the group until launch and that the members of the Discord group were all given <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/the-whitelist-how-to-get-early-access-to-nft-drops\" target=\"_blank\">whitelists</a>, allowing them to mint the Doodle NFT.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Who Is the Team Behind Doodles?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Doodles NFT Collection was created by Scott Martin, Evan Keast, and Jordan Castro. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/burnttoast\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Martin</a>, who also goes by the pseudonym Burnt Toast, is the artist and co-founder behind the collection, while <a href=\"https://twitter.com/evankeast\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Evan Keast</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/poopie\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jordan Castro</a> are the co-founders of the project.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While Martin&rsquo;s main expertise is in the design field, both Keast and Castro have already worked with prominent NFT projects prior to the launch of Doodles. Evan Keast, who goes by the name Tulip, has worked with Dapper Labs, a prominent team that helped successfully launch both the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-flow-blockchain\" target=\"_blank\">Flow Blockchain</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/beginners-guide-to-cryptokitties\" target=\"_blank\">CryptoKitties</a> NFT collection. Castro, who goes by the name Poopie, had also worked with CryptoKitties prior to founding Doodles.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is the Utility of the Doodles Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Holders of the Doodles collection are given exclusive access to events and access to the Doodles ecosystem. During the events, Doodles NFT holders also get to interact with other holders and sometimes even join meet-and-greets with the Doodles team themselves.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Holding a Doodle NFT also gives the owners the right to vote on things that affect the Doodles ecosystem. This can include the team&rsquo;s plan to launch new products or even donations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Moving forward, The NFT Doodles collection <a href=\"https://twitter.com/doodles/status/1541614790862323712\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">aims</a> to become &ldquo;one of the world&rsquo;s leading producers of media and entertainment&rdquo; through having different partnerships such as music and gaming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Doodles\" src=\"//s3.amazonaws.com/assets.coingecko.com/app/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/7518/content_Doodles.png\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 675px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In January 2023, the Doodles team <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/web3/2023/01/23/nft-collection-doodles-acquires-emmy-nominated-animation-studio/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">acquired</a> an Emmy-nominated animation studio &lsquo;Golden Wolf&rsquo; and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/poopie/status/1617518255366897668\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tweeted</a> that the community should expect &ldquo;storytelling without constraints &amp; AI animation generation R&amp;D&rdquo;. In March 2023, Castro, one of the co-founders, sent a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DegenerateNews/status/1636269938620129281\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">message</a> in their Discord informing the community that they have been moving towards becoming an entertainment company and are &ldquo;no longer an NFT project&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While some supported the move from being an NFT project to an entertainment company, the move also caused some <a href=\"https://decrypt.co/123782/doodles-no-longer-nft-project-speculators\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">outrage</a> among Doodles holders and the community. Some saw it as the team trying to become a business, neglecting the NFT community.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The Doodles Ecosystem</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Other than the Doodles NFT collection, the team also produces official expansions to give away to Doodles Holders. One such expansion is the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/space-doodles\" target=\"_blank\">Space Doodles NFT collection</a>, which functions as &ldquo;spaceships for your Doodle&rdquo;. This means that through the smart contract functions, Space Doodles will wrap your Doodles from the original collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The team also launched the Doodles 2 collection. Consisting of 24,000 <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/dynamic-nfts-dnfts\" target=\"_blank\">dynamic NFTs</a>, the new collection is <a href=\"https://flow.com/post/flow-blockchain-doodles-2-announcement\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">built on the Flow Blockchain</a>, which will include customizable traits, a dynamic rarity on their NFTs, and a community-driven development system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This means that in the Doodles 2 collection, NFT holders will be able to dress and customize their Doodles 2 NFTs up based on the wearables that they have, which in term will change the rarity of the NFT. As of July 2023, Doodles 2 is still waiting for its beta stage and has not been officially launched yet, and users are only able to purchase and open a <a href=\"https://home.doodles.app/genesis-box\" target=\"_blank\">Genesis box </a>or <a href=\"https://www.doodles.app/pharrell-pack\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Pharrell Pack</a>, which contains the wearables for the system.</p>\r\n",

    "description": "<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is the Azuki NFT Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Azuki is a collection of 10,000 unique pfpNFTs featuring generative avatar NFTs inspired by anime-style artwork. Commonly used as profile pictures in the community, the Azuki collection has a distinct art style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Launched on 12 January 2022, the NFT collection had a mint price of 1 ETH. The Azuki mint was set up in a Dutch Auction style, with the price of the mint decreasing every 20 minutes by 0.05 ETH till it reached the floor price of 0.15 ETH. However, as the collection was sold out within 4 minutes, all 8,700 NFTs available for the mint were sold for a price of 1 ETH. An unspecified number out of the remaining NFTs were minted through the private <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/the-whitelist-how-to-get-early-access-to-nft-drops\" target=\"_blank\">whitelist</a> sale, which was sold at 0.5 ETH each.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">According to the <a href=\"http://azuki.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>, Azuki aims to be more than just a simple pfpNFT project, but rather a brand for the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-metaverse-crypto-blockchain-nft-game\" target=\"_blank\">metaverse</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Who Is the Team Behind Azuki?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Azuki was created by Chiru Labs, a Los-Angelos-based team that consists of artists and developers &ndash; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/2pmflow\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2pm.flow</a>,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/locationtba\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> location tba</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hoshiboyzen\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">HoshiBoy</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ZAGABOND\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Zagabond</a>. The Azuki team faced backlash when Zagabond was named as one of the project&rsquo;s co-founders, as he had allegedly abandoned 3 different NFT projects previously. Zagabond has since apologized and mentioned that he is committed to &ldquo;stepping up&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is the Utility of the Azuki Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Holding the Azuki NFT gives holders membership access to &lsquo;<a href=\"https://www.azuki.com/en/garden\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Garden</a>&rsquo;. This gives holders exclusive access to streetwear collaborations, early access to future Azuki projects, NFT expansion packs, and member-exclusive events like the Azuki Garden party.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As mentioned, Azuki aims to become a brand for the metaverse, and some investors have speculated that the NFTs could later be used as avatars in-game content.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The Azuki Ecosystem</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Other than the Azuki NFT collection, the team has also produced official expansions to give away to Azuki Holders. One such expansion NFT is the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/beanz-official\" target=\"_blank\">BEANZ Official NFT collection</a>. On the 21st of March 2022, Azuki NFT holders were airdropped the NFT. According to the project&rsquo;s official website, &ldquo;Beanz are a small species that sprouts from the dirt in the garden&rdquo;. The Beanz is a companion expansion as they are meant to be a sidekick to an Azuki.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In January 2023, Azuki announced that the team is working on a gamified metaverse&nbsp;&ndash; <a href=\"https://www.azuki.com/en/world/hilumia\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hilumia</a>. The Hilumia City is an interactive map that teases different 10 locations that will later become unique experiences for the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Azuki collection also consists of the Bobu NFT collection, which is intended to be a governance token, the native token of the Azuki ecosystem. According to the <a href=\"https://www.azuki.com/en/bobu-101\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>, the Bobu NFT will be <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/fractional-nfts\" target=\"_blank\">fractionalized</a> and linked to a holder&rsquo;s Twitter account. The Bobu fractions can be sold to other investors as well.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In June 2023, the team also announced the launch of the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/azuki-elementals\" target=\"_blank\">Azuki NFT Elementals Collection</a>. The collection consists of 20,000 NFTs, which are meant to represent the four domains of the Garden. Out of the 20,000 NFTs, 10,000 were airdropped to attendees at a Las Vegas event, while the remaining 10,000 were to be sold through a Dutch auction. During the auction, Azuki holders were given a 10-minute presale window, followed by another 10-minute window for the Beanz Official NFT collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The initial mint was successful, and all the NFTs were sold out within the presale period. However, after the mint, the team faced backlash as many investors felt that the elementals collection looked too similar to the original collection, causing a potential dilution through an increased supply.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

    "description": "<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is the CyberKongz NFT Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">CyberKongz is a collection of 1,000 pfpNFTs featuring 34x34 pixel&nbsp;images of pixelated gorillas. This collection is known as the Genesis Collection, and the team has since released two other collections &ndash; <a href=\"https://opensea.io/collection/cyberkongz-babies\" target=\"_blank\">Baby CyberKongz</a> and <a href=\"https://opensea.io/collection/cyberkongz-vx\" target=\"_blank\">CyberKongz VX</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Launched on 3 March 2021, the project had a mint price of 0.01 <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\" target=\"_blank\">ETH</a>. At the time of the launch, profile picture NFT projects were considered rare, and the collection drew a lot of interest from NFT enthusiasts who discovered the minting process on OpenSea. The project was fully minted in two days.&nbsp; Just 7 months later, the NFT CyberKongz #445 sold for 208 ETH, which was then equivalent to almost 750,000 USD.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Who Is the Team Behind CyberKongz?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The CyberKongz team has not revealed their identities, and most of them are known by their pseudonyms. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/myoo_ck\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Myoo</a> is the main creator and artist behind the project. The <a href=\"https://www.cyberkongz.com/about\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">team</a> consists of several team members whose roles range from developers to artists.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The Great Kongz Migration</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On 17 April 2021, the CyberKongz NFT collection migrated to a new <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-smart-contracts\" target=\"_blank\">smart contract</a>, which brought in new features such as the breeding of the NFTs, the implementation of the native token <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/banana\" target=\"_blank\">BANANA</a>, and the renaming of the NFTs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is the Utility of the CyberKongz Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To reward early supporters, all holders of the Genesis Cyberkongz collection will be given 10 BANANA a day for the next 10 years. BANANA, the native token of the ecosystem, can be exchanged for money or burnt by holders to customize their own NFT, such as renaming their Kongs or writing a bio. BANANA tokens can also be used to breed CyberKongz.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To breed a Baby CyberKongz, you will need 2 CyberKongz from the Genesis collection and 600 BANANA tokens. Holding a Baby CyberKongz gives holders exclusive access to a members-only Discord server called &lsquo;Wall-St Kongz&rsquo;. The Baby CyberKongz can be used in their Play &amp; Kollect NFT game.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A large sum of the profits from the collection is pumped into donations to help wildlife conservation. For example, in March 2021, 60% of the profits from the mint were donated to Cool Earth and Orangutan Outreach.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The CyberKongz Ecosystem</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While CyberKongz was originally just a 2D PFP NFT project, the CyberKongz ecosystem has grown to be much more intricate &ndash; including 3 different types of collections, the native token BANANA, and a Play &amp; Kollect NFT game.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Other than the Genesis and Baby CyberKongz collection, the team has also released another collection &ndash; CyberKongz VX. Airdropped to Baby CyberKongz, the CyberKongz VX collection is not pixelated but rather in a 2D and 3D format that can be used as avatars for exploring the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/the-sandbox\" target=\"_blank\">SandBox</a> metaverse.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As mentioned, the native token BANANA can be used for the customization and breeding of CyberKongz. Other than customization, BANANA is also a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/governance-tokens\" target=\"_blank\">governance token</a>, and BANANA holders have voting rights over the project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The team has also released a NFT game &ndash; Play &amp; Kollect: Jungle Adventure. The game operates on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-polygon-network-matic-an-ultimate-guide\" target=\"_blank\">Polygon chain</a> in a bid to be more environmentally friendly and reduce gas fees for investors. According to the website, token yield and airdrops will possibly be distributed to investors using the same mechanism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The team is also currently in the midst of working on a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-metaverse-crypto-blockchain-nft-game\" target=\"_blank\">metaverse</a> and a battle royale mini-game named &lsquo;Kongquest&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

    "description": "<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is the DeGods NFT Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">DeGods is a collection of 10,000 pfpNFTs featuring &lsquo;degenerate&rsquo; ancient deities dressed in&nbsp;modern streetwear. The project originally launched on the Solana chain but later <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/06/15/why-degods-nfts-seem-to-be-everywhere/?sh=551596db20de\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> the migration of the DeGods NFT collection to Ethereum in December 2022. This decision was amidst the problems that the Solana chain was facing in 2022. The DeGods project only officially migrated to the Ethereum chain in 2023.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Launched on 8 October 2021, the DeGods collection sold out within 7 seconds and had a mint price of 3 SOL. 11 months later, a DeGods NFT <a href=\"https://solscan.io/tx/2mRHBDnvpRk3c7gsibS5TUabhwnsc4d4LkXevrxgE9FngfDYHhV7AoNeSximeGUZZitwe66MLPvBWWFw5ipjnTTz\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sold</a> for 7033.3 SOL. Widely known for the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DeGodsNFT/status/1519672039962935297?\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">acquisition</a> of a professional basketball team named the &lsquo;Killer 3s&rsquo;, the DeGods NFT project is one of the more notable projects in the NFT space. Celebrities like David Beckham and Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal were also among the holders of the DeGods collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project is also well known for the implementation of a &lsquo;Paper Hand Bitch Tax&rsquo; (PHBT), a tax meant to punish <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/paper-hands-in-crypto\" target=\"_blank\">paper hands</a>, which are known as investors who sell their investment at the first sign of financial turmoil in fear of potential losses. The tax meant there would be a 33.3% tax on the sale if a seller sold their NFT below the mint price of 3 SOL. The idea of a tax was the first of its kind, and it quickly gained visibility and popularity among investors. Despite its popularity, the tax system did not fare well, and on the 1st of January 2022, the team abolished the PHBT system.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Who Is the Team Behind DeGods?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The NFT collection is managed by <a href=\"https://www.dustlabs.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dust Labs</a>, which is also the same team behind the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/y00ts#\" target=\"_blank\">y00ts NFT collection</a> on Polygon. The team is led by Rohun Vora, who went by the pseudonym <a href=\"https://twitter.com/frankdegods\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Frank DeGods</a> before he doxxed himself in November 2022. Rohun is a serial entrepreneur in web3, who was previously pursuing a degree in Film at UCLA but dropped out. Likewise, the CEO of Dust Labs, Kevin DeGods, also doxxed himself and revealed his identity as tech entrepreneur Kevin Henrikson.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is the Utility of the DeGods Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The DeGods NFT collection is known to have one of the strongest NFT communities, with many investors using their DeGods NFTs as profile pictures on social media.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Holders of the DeGods collection are also able to generate <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dust-protocol\" target=\"_blank\">DUST</a> tokens by staking their NFTs. DUST is the native token of the DeDAO, which is a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/daos-community-organizers-of-web3\" target=\"_blank\">decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)</a> that governs the DeGods ecosystem. This allows holders of the DeGods collection to generate some passive income while holding their NFTs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The DUST earned can then be spent on its native marketplace, where investors are able to buy exclusive whitelist spots for upcoming projects, merchandise, courtside tickets, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/blue-chip-nft-projects\" target=\"_blank\">blue-chip NFTs</a>, and even V-Bucks for Fortnite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Holders of the DeGod collection are also given exclusive access to a Discord group, which allows holders of the collection to interact with one another.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">DeadGods</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With the DUST generated from staking their DeGods, DeGods holders were also able to &ldquo;transcend&rdquo; their NFT to a DeadGod. The DeadGods are not a separate collection, as it still contains the metadata of the original DeGods. This essentially means that DeGods and DeadGods are two different versions of the same NFT. By transcending your DeGod to DeadGods, holders can mine more dust when staking their NFTs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Holders of DeadGods were also given an exclusive <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/the-whitelist-how-to-get-early-access-to-nft-drops\" target=\"_blank\">whitelist</a> to mint Dust Lab&rsquo;s other NFT project, y00ts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">DeGods on Bitcoin&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In March 2023, 535 DeGods NFTs were burnt and minted on Bitcoin. This was after the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/bitcoin-ordinals-nft\" target=\"_blank\">Ordinals</a> protocol was introduced in February 2023, allowing users to hold NFTs on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-bitcoin\" target=\"_blank\">Bitcoin blockchain</a>. Of the 535 NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain, 500 of the NFTs were minted with BTC, while the remaining 34 were auctioned or raffled off in DUST.</p>\r\n",

    "description": "<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is the mfers NFT Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Short for motherf***ers, the mfers NFT collection is a pfpNFT collection of 10,021 unique NFTs featuring distinct stickman figures inspired by the popular &lsquo;Are you winning son?&rsquo; meme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Out of the 10,021 NFTs of the mfers collection, 21 of the NFTs are rare and differ significantly from their counterparts. These rare NFTs feature different dialogues and avatars, with some of these NFTs drawing inspiration from popular NFT collections like <a href=\"https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x79fcdef22feed20eddacbb2587640e45491b757f/9547\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BAYC</a> and <a href=\"https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x79fcdef22feed20eddacbb2587640e45491b757f/5688\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CryptoPunks</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Launched on 30 November 2021, the mfers NFT collection had an original mint price of 0.069 ETH. The collection sold out within 10 minutes despite not having done any paid promotions or whitelisting prior to the launch. The mfers NFT collection is also part of the public domain and users are able to use it in any way that they desire.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Who Is Behind mfers?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The mfers NFT collection was created by Sartoshi, a famous NFT influencer and Twitter personality. In 2022, after launching another NFT project titled &lsquo;<a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/end-of-sartoshi\" target=\"_blank\">End of Sartoshi</a>&rsquo;, Sartoshi has since deactivated his Twitter account (previously @sartishi_nft).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In his <a href=\"https://mirror.xyz/sartoshi.eth/VQB_rWveDQuut4GQKcFA6aqL9hM3rS7raYwsW3UfdLA\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a>, Sartoshi announced that he transferred the NFT&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-smart-contracts\" target=\"_blank\">smart contract</a> to the mfers community via the unofficial mfers <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/mpc-wallet-vs-multi-sig-wallets\" target=\"_blank\">multi-sig wallet</a>. Moving forward, 50% of the royalties from the collection will go straight to the multi-sig wallet where the community will be able to decide what to do with the funds. The remaining 50% of royalties will be divided among Sartoshi himself, other developers, and consultants who worked on the project.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The mfers NFT Collection Roadmap</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Despite Sartoshi&rsquo;s early departure from the project, the mfers NFT community has bonded together and formed the mfers decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Through the use of their DAO, the community can vote on the project&rsquo;s direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Other than access to exclusive Discord groups, holders of the mfers NFT collection will also be given access to a 3D MFerverse filled with 3D mfers and new tokens. There have also been many different spinoff NFT collections that are inspired by the mfers collection &ndash; <a href=\"https://opensea.io/collection/mfers-in-paradise\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">mfers in paradise</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/ape-mfers\" target=\"_blank\">ape mfers</a>, and many more. The team is also working on expanding their project, such as a merchandise store, an inspired book, and even songs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

This gives Panda holders access to high-profile events such as concerts, sports events, networking events, meet-and-greets with celebrities, poker tournaments, and much more.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2023 alone, the Kanpai Pandas team has already more than 40 <a href=\"https://kanpaipandas.io/events\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">events</a> lined up for their holders. This includes real-world events like access to a suite in the Allegiant Stadium for Beyonce&rsquo;s Renaissance World Tour in Las Vegas.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to access to exclusive events, the Kanpai team has also teased the release of new artwork collections, exclusive merchandise and airdrops for Kanpai Pandas NFT holders.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The Kanpai Pandas Ecosystem</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Other than the original collection, the team has also released another NFT collection titled <a href=\"https://opensea.io/collection/kanpai-pandas-infinity-collection\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kanpai Pandas Infinity Collection.</a> Kanpai Pandas Infinity is a collection of 250 unique NFTs that was an exclusive mint for Kanpai Pandas holders who accumulated 1 Panda on each of the 6 chains &ndash; Ethereum, BNB, AVAX, Arbitrum, Polygon, and Optimism.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While the Kanpai Pandas Infinity collection still retains resemblance to the original collection, the collection has their own set of unique traits &ndash; such as brighter and more dynamic backgrounds, and a custom soundtrack.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project also has its own proprietary point system, <a href=\"https://kanpai-labs.gitbook.io/kp-docs/panda-point-mechanics\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Panda Points</a>, where users can earn points depending on the NFT&rsquo;s rarity score. These points can then be used to purchase new traits from the Panda Lab marketplace, and overall increase the rarity of their Panda NFT. Holders can also spend their points within their own in-app games like Kanpai Casino, Kanpai Gaming, or spend their points to join bounties and raffles within the <a href=\"https://kanpai-labs.gitbook.io/kp-docs/ppdex\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Panda Points DEX</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2022, the team also launched their &lsquo;Fantasy Sports&rsquo; initiative, where holders are able to compete in online games like World Cup Fantasy or Fantasy NFL during the seasons. The winners of these Fantasy games were awarded prizes like Super Bowl tickets, cash, and Panda NFTs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Moving forward, the Kanpai Pandas team is currently working on making retail products, a comic/ animation series, and more ways to reach the non-native crypto users.&nbsp;</p>",

    "description": "After more than a century in circulation, the penny has become both a worthless relic of inflation and a prized collector's item. The last copper pennies were minted in 1982, after which they have been struck in zinc. A penny from any given year will always be worth exactly 1¢, according to the US Treasury, but the copper in pre-1982 pennies has a metal value of approximately 3¢. Recognizing these discrepancies in value, Rutherford Chang removed 10,000 copper coins from circulation and archivally documented them. The final state of these 10,000 copper cents are inscribed on 10,000 satoshis, while the physical coins are smelted and cast into a solid 68-pound copper block. This metal block is rendered as a three-dimensional digital model and inscribed as a 4-megabyte ordinal, comprising the entirety of Bitcoin block #839969. As the traditional penny fades into irrelevance and its production is ultimately terminated, its value can continue to be redefined. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"//rutherfordchang.com/cents\">rutherfordchang.com/cents</a>",

Originally planned to be launched on the Ethereum blockchain, the team later decided to switch chains over to Solana making it more accessible for the masses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project places a significant emphasis on helping the less fortunate and as of 30 August 2023, the project has already donated more than 750 SOL to various charities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Who Is the Team Behind the Famous Fox Federation?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/draxxts\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DraxxTs</a> is the co-founder of the Famous Fox NFT collection and an avid investor in cryptocurrency and NFTs. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FoxyDev42\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">FoxyDev</a>&nbsp;is the lead developer , and the rest of the team consists of individuals from different backgrounds, handling development, social media management, moderation, strategic partnerships, and art.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is the Utility of the Famous Fox Federation Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Other than access to the project&rsquo;s holders-only Discord channel and community, Famous Fox NFT holders are able to enjoy free access to their internal tools like <a href=\"https://famousfoxes.com/wallpaper\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Wallpaper Maker </a>and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://famous-fox-federation.gitbook.io/famous-fox-federation/utilities/banner-builder\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Banner Builder</a>.

While this collection is also able to participate in staking and has the same rarity as the Genesis collection, they will only receive a quarter of FOXY rewards that the Genesis collection would receive.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The honorary collection, the Famous Fox Friends &amp; Foes NFT collection consists of 1/1 NFTs that are auctioned off for FOXY regularly. These NFTs are created by various guest artists and earn holders 100 FOXY daily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The last collection, Famous Fox Dens NFTs is a metaverse collection of 3,000 NFTs Dens which serves as an ownership key to their Dens &ndash; rooms in the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-metaverse-crypto-blockchain-nft-game\" target=\"_blank\">metaverse</a> that can be decorated and customized.

    "description": "<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is the Okay Bears NFT Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Okay Bears is a collection of 10,000 pfpNFTs featuring unique bears wearing modern clothes. Known for having a welcoming community, the Okay Bears project has an uplifting and positive motto &ndash; &lsquo;We&rsquo;re all gonna be okay.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Launched on 26 April 2022, the project had a mint price of 1.5 <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/solana\" target=\"_blank\">SOL</a>. On the day of the mint, the Okay Bears had already generated almost 18 million dollars in secondary sales. This was a record for any Solana NFT project, making the Okay Bears project one of the most sought-after NFT projects in the space.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From the beginning, the Okay Bears project was centered around exclusivity. To gain invite-only access to the exclusive Discord channel, users had to follow specific instructions, such as changing their profile pictures. Even after joining the Discord channel, members still had to vie for a spot on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/the-whitelist-how-to-get-early-access-to-nft-drops\" target=\"_blank\">whitelist</a>, making the project extremely elusive and hyped.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Who Is the Team Behind Okay Bears?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Okay Bears NFT collection was co-founded by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kaisisokay\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kais</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/suby_sol\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Suby</a>. While Kais has an extensive background in graphic design, art history, and branding, Suby comes from an engineering background and has experience leading NFT collection projects for established international teams. The rest of the Okay Bears <a href=\"https://www.okaybears.com/park\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">team</a> consists of individuals from diverse backgrounds, including artists, developers, engineering, and even an educator.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is the Utility of the Okay Bears Collection?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Holders of the Okay Bears NFT collection are granted full access to the Okay Bears ecosystem virtual community. Holders are also granted early access to any new projects, collaborations, or events that the Okay Bears Team may release in the future. These can include any possible new NFT collection, member-only merchandise, exclusive live events, and metaverse experiences.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In line with Okay Bears&rsquo; positive motto, Okay Bears <a href=\"https://www.okaybears.com/okay-cares\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">claim</a> to &ldquo;represent a culture shift in charitable fundraising, using NFTs for positive community impact and global change for good&rdquo;. The project has partnered with 4 different charity programs to give back to the community &ndash; including <a href=\"https://www.okaybears.com/red\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">RED</a>, <a href=\"https://www.okaybears.com/okay-cares-2/unhcr\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">UNHCR</a>, <a href=\"https://www.okaybears.com/okay-cares-2/movember\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Movember</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.okaybears.com/okay-cares-2/heir-lonzo-ball\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Heir &amp; Lonzo Ball</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Okay Bears team has also previously announced plans to create a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-metaverse-crypto-blockchain-nft-game\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">metaverse</a> for holders of the NFT collection.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The Okay Bears Ecosystem</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Okay Bears team has created an elaborate blueprint map that explains the vision for the NFT project. The blueprint includes 7 spaces &ndash; The Park, Bear Market, Studio, Workshop, Gallery, Boutique, and Platform.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"Okay Bears Blueprint\" src=\"//s3.amazonaws.com/assets.coingecko.com/app/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/7548/content_Okay_Bears.png\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 611px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &lsquo;Bear Market&rsquo;, built exclusively for Okay Bears NFT holders, includes an ecosystem of web3, web2, and IRL sales channels. This includes a &lsquo;BEAR MARKET X MAGIC EDEN&rsquo; partnership, where Okay Bears holders can&nbsp;buy and sell Okay Bears on Magic Eden with special member-only perks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &lsquo;Studio&rsquo;, also built exclusively for Okay Bears NFT holders, gives holders early access to any new projects the Okay Bears Team may release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As mentioned, &lsquo;The Park&rsquo; is a Discord server likened to a digital meeting space for the Okay Bears community.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The &lsquo;Workshop&rsquo; consists of public awareness projects and community engagement to boost visibility for the Okay Bears NFT projects. This is done through outdoor advertising and collaborations with big brands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The &lsquo;Gallery&rsquo; is made to showcase Okay Bear NFT holders and their fan art. This includes a section on a curated fan art display, with an emphasis on the artists and their communities. The Gallery also includes real-life NFT art exhibitions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The &lsquo;Boutique&rsquo; includes merchandise and collections. Through a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/token-gating\" target=\"_blank\">token-gated</a> shop, NFT holders are able to claim a complimentary physical welcome pack. The shop also includes some exclusive holders-only merchandise and collaborations with other fashion brands to boost awareness.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Last but not least, the blueprint also includes the &lsquo;Platform&rsquo;, which includes information about keynotes, conferences, and meetups of the NFT community. This also includes exclusive meetups for holders of Okay Bears.&nbsp;</p>",

    "description": "Art Blocks Collection: Curated\r\n\r\nHeritage Art Blocks Collection: Curated series 4\r\n\r\nProject Description: “Fragments of an infinite field” is a compositional system in which an idealized plant species is generated and arranged in a potentially infinite field of foliage. The main environmental parameter of the composition is the determination of a season of the year. The season determines the landscape’s colors and defines specific phenomena for each of them, such as rain in summer, snow in winter, petals falling in autumn, and pollen in spring. The flower has several possible variables, which can be macro aspects, affecting the entire population of the species, or micro, affecting each individual of the species differently. For example, the number of petals can be equal in all individuals or not. The number of filaments and other structures of the flower can undergo minor deviations, generating small mutations. The confusion between the figure (plant) and the background (earth, sky, other natural elements) is fascinating from a compositional point of view. The background colors are, most of the time, colors present in the figures, often breaking the boundary between them and, therefore, generating chromatic masses. In this project I also intend to research the following question: How to create parameters that resemble a living organism's growth? In this sense, the project approaches digital morphogenesis and the development of procedural organisms.",
